# Connect Four Game

Connect Four is a classic two-player connection game in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs into a grid. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.

This project aims to implement the Connect Four game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: HTML file defining the structure of the game, including the grid and necessary elements.
- `styles.css`: CSS file containing styles for the visual presentation of the game.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file implementing the game logic, including player moves, win conditions, and game reset functionality.

## Getting Started

To play the Connect Four game, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The game will be displayed in the browser window, and players can take turns dropping their colored discs into the grid by clicking on the desired column.

## Features

- HTML structure defining the game grid and elements.
- CSS styles for visually appealing game presentation.
- JavaScript logic handling player moves, win conditions, and game reset.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Players take turns clicking on the desired column to drop their colored discs.
